Pink Floyd's history is as fascinating as their music. The band was formed in London in 1965 by four students who shared a passion for blues, rock, and avant-garde music. They initially called themselves the Tea Set, but changed their name to Pink Floyd after discovering another band with the same name. The new name was inspired by two American bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.

The band's original leader was Syd Barrett, a charismatic and eccentric singer-songwriter who wrote most of their early songs. Barrett's psychedelic style and whimsical lyrics gave Pink Floyd a distinctive identity and a cult following in the underground scene. However, his excessive use of LSD and mental instability soon affected his performance and behavior, leading to his departure from the band in 1968. He was replaced by David Gilmour, a childhood friend of Barrett and an accomplished guitarist.
 
After Barrett's departure, Pink Floyd gradually shifted from psychedelic pop to progressive rock, exploring more complex and experimental sounds and themes. The band's main songwriter became Roger Waters, who developed ambitious concept albums that dealt with topics such as war, madness, alienation, and society. Some of these albums, such as The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979), became huge commercial and critical successes, making Pink Floyd one of the most popular and influential bands of all time.
